# My Mission
In my current city, Berlin as an example, it is very difficult to find accommodation, either for long-term rentals or for short-term visits to the city. At the same time, many foreigners living in this city return to their home countries for a short period of time, leaving the city with a lot of short-term vacancies. This seems to me to be a waste of resources.<br>I created this online service platform to connect people who want to rent out their rooms with people who are looking for accommodations in specific cities, with the goal of achieving a sharing economy.
